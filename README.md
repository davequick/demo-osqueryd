# Running on a mac

```console
bash ./run-demo.sh
```

then demo the data rolling into kibana... 

then to simulate someone doing potential bad things to a system, we'll just copy an executable in sbin... 
```console
bash ./demo2.sh
```

now go and search for badactor and find the record of a new file being introduced

then change it again... 
```console
bash ./demo3.sh
```

and show a second line recorded that details a change in /sbin/ to the same file.
